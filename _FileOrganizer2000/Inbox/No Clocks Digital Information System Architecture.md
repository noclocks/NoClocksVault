This updated architecture is centered on integrating the tools seamlessly and ensuring that data flows effectively between different stages of the technology development lifecycle. Each tool is chosen for its specific strengths, and together they form a cohesive system for managing the company's operations.

For visual representation, you would create a diagram similar to the one you provided, with clear labels for each category and subcategory of tools, and arrows to indicate the flow of information. You'd also include the company's logo and name, No Clocks, LLC, to personalize the architecture.

Additionally, considering that you're a technology-based startup skilled in software engineering, you might want to incorporate automated workflows and DevOps practices within your architecture to streamline the deployment and integration processes. This would include CI/CD pipelines (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment), automated testing, and regular code reviews to ensure high standards of quality and efficiency.

Would you like to visualize this updated architecture in a diagram format? If so, I can sketch out a more detailed layout based on your specifications.
