## Code Snippet

Add the Logo `<meta>` tag to your [[Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)|HTML]] to make it easy for anyone access your logo. Logos you choose will take precedence in our response and will let everyone know which logo you want out in the world.

```html
<meta property="og:logo" content="logo.png">
```

to specify a size:

```html
<meta property="og:logo" content="logo.png" size="120x120">
```
