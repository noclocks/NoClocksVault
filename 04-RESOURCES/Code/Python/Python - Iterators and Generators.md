# Iterators and Generators Python Code

```table-of-contents
title: Contents 
style: nestedList # TOC style (nestedList|inlineFirstLevel)
minLevel: 1 # Include headings from the specified level
maxLevel: 4 # Include headings up to the specified level
includeLinks: true # Make headings clickable
debugInConsole: false # Print debug info in Obsidian console
```

## Code Snippets

### Bad Example (Memory Intensive)

```python
def process_large_file(filename):
    all_lines = open(filename).readlines() # Yikes! Loading everything at once  
	results = []  
	for line in all_lines:  
		# Do some processing on each line  
		results.append(process_line(line))  
	return results
```

### Good Example (Generator)

```python
def process_huge_file_generator(filename):
    with open(filename) as f:
        for line in f:
            yield process_line(line)  # Process on demand, no giant lists

# Using the generator
for result in process_huge_file_generator("massive_log.txt"):
    # Do something with each result
```

## Details

The generator approach processes your file line-by-line, yielding results as needed. Your memory usage stays sane, even with massive datasets. This is a core principle behind how Google handles enormous amounts of data â€” efficiency at scale.

To enhance the code even more,  you can *chain generators together to create elegant data processing pipelines.*
