## Overview

> [!SOURCE] Sources:
> - **

There is always a time you need to work with text files in [[_README|PowerShell]]. 

Text files are the simplest form of files and [[_README|PowerShell]] has built in commands to interact with them. 

Since PowerShell uses the verb command approach remembering these or typing them could be seen as time consuming, but the power we have over text files is great. 

## Commands

Hereâ€™s some basic commands you might be familiar with:

| Command | Alias |
| --- | --- |
| `Get-Content` | `cat` |
| `Select-String` | `grep` |
| `Set-Content` |  |
| `Sort-Object` | `sort` |
| `Measure-Object` | `measure` |
| `Select-First` | `first` |
| `Select-Last` | `last` |

## Examples

Let's assume there is a log file (`test.log`) and we want to read some of the text from it.

To read the entire file:

```powershell
Get-Content test.log
```

```powershell


## Code Snippet

```powershell

```
