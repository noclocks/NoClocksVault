# CSS Match Form Control Colors with Page Styles Code

```table-of-contents

minLevel: 1 # Include headings from the specified level
maxLevel: 4 # Include headings up to the specified level
includeLinks: true # Make headings clickable
debugInConsole: false # Print debug info in Obsidian console
```

## Code Snippet

```css
body {
  accent-color: #080; /* use your favorite color */
}
```

Another small change that does not have a significant impact but that makes things look better. Until recently, we could not style native form controls with CSS and were stuck with the browser display. But things have changed.

Developing a whole component can be a pain, but setting a color that is more similar to the rest of the site and the design system is possible and straightforward with this one-liner.

![side by side comparison. Left (before): form controls are the default blue . Right (after): form controls color match the heading and link colors (green).](https://alvaromontoro.com/images/blog/one-liner-6.webp)
