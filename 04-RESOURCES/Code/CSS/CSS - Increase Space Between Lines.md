# CSS Increase Space Between Lines Code

```table-of-contents
title: ## Contents 
style: nestedList # TOC style (nestedList|inlineFirstLevel)
minLevel: 1 # Include headings from the specified level
maxLevel: 4 # Include headings up to the specified level
includeLinks: true # Make headings clickable
debugInConsole: false # Print debug info in Obsidian console
```

## Code Snippet

```css
body {
  line-height: 1.5;
}
```

Another preference for improving readability and breaking the dreaded wall of text is increasing the space between lines in paragraphs and content. We can easily do it with the `line-height` property.

![side by side comparison. Left (before): column with text. Right (after): column with text (more spaced).](https://alvaromontoro.com/images/blog/one-liner-2.webp)

This choice (with the previous two) will considerably increase our page's vertical size, but I assure you the text will be more readable and friendlier for all users.
