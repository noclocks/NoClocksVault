## Overview

Creating and maintaining documentation for a [[TypeScript]] project of any size can quickly become a herculean task. `docs-ts` simplifies this process by allowing you to co-locate your documentation with its associated code. 

You simply annotate your code with [[JSDoc]] comments, and then the [[CLI]] will generate beautiful [[Markdown]] documents containing all of the documentation and examples you associated with your code. 

In addition, the generated output of `docs-ts` can be used as a [publishing source](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source) for your repository's documentation on [[Tool - GitHub|GitHub]].

## Usage

Using `docs-ts` is as simple as annotating your code with [[JSDoc]] comments. Specialized [[JSDoc]] tags can be used to perform various functions, such as grouping associated code together, versioning documentation, and running and testing source code. A full list of supported [[JSDoc]] tags can be found below.
