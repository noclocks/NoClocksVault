## Overview

Intuit's [QuickBooks Online](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/) is an obvious choice when selecting accounting software for
a startup. It's both intuitive and powerful, while the software's APIs can integrate with payroll software such as
[Rippling](https://www.rippling.com/) to manage employee salaries or [Bill.com](https://www.bill.com/) to help with
bill payments as needed.

In addition, most accountants are already familiar with some form of QuickBooks or another; Intuit's offering is
one of the best-established brands of accounting software on the market. While some companies opt to use
[QuickBooks Desktop](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/desktop/) (now only available in the US), QuickBooks Online allows
accountants and business owners unfettered access to the software from a mobile device. An increasingly useful ability.

The software's business-friendly features make it one of the best pieces of accounting software.
