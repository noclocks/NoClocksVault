## Overview

![](https://i.imgur.com/eY9XT5k.png)

PageSpeed Insights (PSI) reports on the user experience of a page on both mobile and desktop devices, and provides suggestions on how that page may be improved.

PSI provides both lab and field data about a page. Lab data is useful for debugging issues, as it is collected in a controlled environment. However, it may not capture real-world bottlenecks. Field data is useful for capturing true, real-world user experience - but has a more limited set of metrics. See [How To Think About Speed Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/speed-tools) for more information on the two types of data.
