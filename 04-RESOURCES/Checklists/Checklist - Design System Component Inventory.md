The first task is creating an inventory of your components to identify the most used. It often involves manually cataloging screens in various websites or apps to discern common UI patterns. Designers like [Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/interface-inventory/) and [Nathan Curtis](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/the-component-cut-up-workshop-1378ae110517) have published handy methodologies for inventorying components so we won’t go into further detail in this tutorial.

Useful heuristics for developers:
- If a UI pattern is used more than three times, turn it into a reusable UI component.
- If a UI component is used in 3 or more projects/teams, put it in your design system.
