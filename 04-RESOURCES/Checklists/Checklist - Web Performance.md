### Why Web Performance Matters

> [!SOURCE] Sources:

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, the performance of a website has become a determining factor in the success of online businesses. It is not only essential for enhancing user experience but also plays a pivotal role in increasing user engagement and improving conversion rates.

One of the primary advantages of having a well-performing website is the ability to capture and retain user attention. Slow-loading websites often lead to high bounce rates, where visitors leave the site before engaging with its content. [Google's research](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/) reveals that as page load time increases from one to three seconds, the probability of a bounce increases by 32%. Therefore, the faster a website loads, the lower the chances of users abandoning it.

A fast and responsive website not only prevents bounce rates but also significantly improves user experience. In a study conducted by [Akamai Technologies](https://www.akamai.com/uk/en/resources/webinars-and-presentations/webinar-how-web-performance-impacts-business-success.jsp), it was found that 47% of consumers expect a web page to load in two seconds or less, and 40% of them abandon a website that takes more than three seconds to load. These statistics highlight the importance of optimizing page speed to cater to user expectations and provide a seamless browsing experience.

Furthermore, a website's loading speed directly impacts the number of page views it receives. [Yahoo's research](https://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html) suggests that a mere 400-millisecond delay in page load time can lead to a 5-9% decrease in page views. Consequently, a fast-loading website encourages users to navigate through the site more extensively, increasing their overall engagement and interaction with the content.

In the realm of e-commerce, where the ultimate goal is to convert visitors into paying customers, website performance becomes even more critical. A fast and efficient website contributes to customer satisfaction, a key factor in driving conversions. [Forrester Consulting](https://www.akamai.com/uk/en/multimedia/documents/analyst-reports/forrester-economic-impact-of-akamai-web-performance-solutions.pdf) reveals that 47% of consumers expect a web page to load in two seconds or less, and 40% abandon a page that takes more than three seconds. By ensuring a swift loading time, businesses can meet user expectations and create a positive impression, ultimately leading to higher customer satisfaction.

The impact of website performance on conversion rates and sales cannot be overstated. [Retail giant Walmart](https://www.woorank.com/en/blog/walmart-com-page-load-speed) reported a 2% increase in conversions for every one-second improvement in page load time. This correlation clearly demonstrates that a faster website directly translates into more conversions and revenue. A seamless and efficient online shopping experience not only drives immediate sales but also contributes to positive brand perception and customer loyalty.

To support these assertions, various studies and research have been conducted, providing concrete evidence of the relationship between website performance and business success in e-commerce. Notable sources include [Google's benchmark](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/) for mobile page speed, [Akamai Technologies'](https://www.akamai.com/uk/en/resources/webinars-and-presentations/webinar-how-web-performance-impacts-business-success.jsp) study on the importance of web performance, [Yahoo's research](https://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html) on the cost of poor web performance, [Forrester Consulting's](https://www.akamai.com/uk/en/multimedia/documents/analyst-reports/forrester-economic-impact-of-akamai-web-performance-solutions.pdf) analysis of the economic impact of web performance solutions, [Walmart's](https://www.woorank.com/en/blog/walmart-com-page-load-speed) case study on page load speed and sales, and the [Aberdeen Group's](https://www.akamai.com/uk/en/multimedia/documents/white-paper/the-performance-of-web-applications-conversion.pdf) report on the performance of web applications.

In today's fiercely competitive digital landscape, optimizing website performance is vital for the success of e-commerce businesses. A well-performing website not only enhances user engagement but also improves conversion rates, leading to increased sales and revenue. Studies consistently demonstrate that faster page load times result in reduced bounce rates, improved user experience, increased page views, higher customer satisfaction, and a positive brand perception. Therefore, investing in website performance optimization is a strategic decision for any online business aiming to thrive in the ever-evolving digital marketplace.

## Introduction

- Understand the Framework and System Architecture:
	- Using a tool efficiently implies understanding its components and capabilities. This allows for a healthy codebase from the start.
	- Example: Create components like `Image` that help accelerate the efficient delivery of images, but users can still use the `<img>` [[Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)|HTML]] element if they prefer.
- Learn to Analyze Performance:
	- Learn to analyze the performance of your pages. Navigating a page should not be slow, not even for you. **If it's slow for the developer, it will be slow for the user**. Understand the available tools and how they work.
- Ongoing Monitoring for Performance:
	- Once the system stops performing, it is common to stop caring about performance until it becomes much more difficult to make corrections. Detecting performance issues is an ongoing task, but it should not be an end in itself.
	- Important: the most important thing (the golden rule) is the user experience. Sometimes the system may not deliver the best performance, as long as it is a conscious decision to deliver the best experience to the user.

### Analyze Page Performance

Testing performance involves understanding a series of tools and possible metrics that seek to understand what needs to be improved (and how). There are tools that help in this process. Understand how and when to use them.

### Local Testing

**Always test your page, section, loader, or action locally. It doesn't always need to be a structured test**. If it's already slow for you, it will be slow for the user.

Run the deployed test versions. Then use the tools available in the browser itself to debug performance issues. With them, you can monitor the performance of the page in detail and simulate adverse conditions (such as a lower quality network or CPU). More information in the guide below:
