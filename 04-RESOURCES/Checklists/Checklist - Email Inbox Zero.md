## Checklist

### Delete. Delete. Delete.

> [!TIP]
> In order to bring clarity from chaos it is first necessary to remove all the clutter.

Don't be afraid to get rid of unnecessary emails. Not every event invitation is important enough to be filed away. Those rant emails I sometimes send to my friends? Definitely trash material. 

As for more serious emails, like receipts, there are some questions you have to ask yourself first. Will you need this receipt later on? Is there a possibility that you'll need to return the item and require the receipt? Will you be expensing the purchase come tax time? In those cases, keep it. A receipt for that bag you really wanted? Not really a splurge I want to be reminded of, nor one that I can legitimately write off come tax time.

### Unsubscribe

Once you find that you're no longer reading a particular email, or that you no longer find emails from a certain organization helpful, unsubscribe from their mailing list. Usually, you'll know that the time to unsubscribe has come when you no longer open the emails in question. Or if you _do_ open them, but don't click on anything within, then it's probably time to let go.

### Routines

Most of my newsletters land in my mailbox between the hours of 7-11am. I try to read and file each one away as they come in. On days when that doesn't happen, I try to catch up by the end of the day, and end the day with no unread emails in my mailbox. 

If an email requires action, eg a response or a payment if it's a bill, then I will keep it in my mailbox until I have dealt with it. I maintain similar routines for work and personal emails. 

It also helps to impose limits on your inbox. My personal limit is that there should be no more than 30 emails in my inbox at any given time.
