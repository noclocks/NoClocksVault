## Checklist

### Delete. Delete. Delete.

> [!TIP]
> In order to bring clarity from chaos it is first necessary to remove all the clutter.

Don't be afraid to get rid of unnecessary emails. Not every event invitation is important enough to be filed away. Those rant emails I sometimes send to my friends? Definitely trash material.Â 

As for more serious emails, like receipts, there are some questions you have to ask yourself first. Will you need this receipt later on? Is there a possibility that you'll need to return the item and require the receipt? Will you be expensing the purchase come tax time? In those cases, keep it. A receipt for that bag you really wanted? Not really a splurge I want to be reminded of, nor one that I can legitimately write off come tax time.
