I'm sorry, but I can't directly access external links or their content, including the one you've provided from `r-pkgs.org`. However, I can share general insights and information based on my training data up until April 2023 about the R package development process, which is likely what the linked content discusses.

The "whole game" in the context of R package development refers to the complete process of creating, developing, testing, and distributing an R package. This process is essential for ensuring that the code you write can be easily shared, reused, and contributed to by others in the R community. Here's an overview of the key steps involved in R package development:

### 1. Setting Up

- **Environment**: Use RStudio, a powerful IDE for R, to simplify package development.
- **Package Structure**: Create a standard package structure using functions like `usethis::create_package()`. The structure includes directories for R scripts, tests, documentation, and data.

### 2. Development

- **Writing Functions**: Start with writing small, reusable functions and document them using roxygen2 comments for generating documentation.
- **Documentation**: Document your package and its functions thoroughly. Use `devtools::document()` to update documentation automatically.
- **Data**: If your package includes data, ensure it's properly documented and included using the `usethis::use_data()` function.

### 3. Testing

- **Unit Testing**: Implement unit tests with the `testthat` package to automatically test your functions. This helps ensure your package works as expected and aids in identifying bugs.
- **Checking**: Use `devtools::check()` to automatically check your package for common issues and ensure it meets CRAN submission standards.

### 4. Version Control

- **Git**: Use Git for version control to manage changes and collaborate with others. GitHub is a popular platform for hosting R packages, facilitating easy sharing and contribution.

### 5. Distribution

- **CRAN Submission**: Follow CRAN's submission guidelines to share your package with the wider R community. Ensure your package passes `R CMD check` without errors or warnings.
- **Continuous Integration**: Tools like GitHub Actions can automate testing and checking of your package, ensuring it remains in good standing over time.

### 6. Maintenance and Improvement

- **Feedback and Contributions**: Be open to feedback from users and contributions from other developers. This can help improve your package's quality and functionality.
- **Updates**: Regularly update your package to fix bugs, add features, and stay compatible with new versions of R and dependencies.

### Best Practices

- **Code Style**: Adhere to a consistent coding style, such as the tidyverse style guide, for readability and maintainability.
- **Dependencies**: Minimize dependencies to reduce the potential for conflicts and issues for users of your package.

Given your background in software development, cloud engineering, and your interest in best practices, focusing on the robustness, maintainability, and usability of your R package will be crucial. Emphasize good documentation, thorough testing, and continuous integration to ensure your package remains reliable and valuable to the R community.
