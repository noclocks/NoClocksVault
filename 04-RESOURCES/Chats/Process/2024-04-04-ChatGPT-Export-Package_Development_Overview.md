The introduction to "R Packages" (2nd Edition) outlines the importance of packages in R as the fundamental unit of shareable code, combining code, data, documentation, and tests. It highlights the vast array of over 19,000 packages on CRAN and encourages readers to develop their own packages for easier code sharing and organization. The book aims to automate package development as much as possible, utilizing the devtools package and RStudio for a more efficient workflow.
