"""[8 Things to know before leaving findlaw] hey everybody Andy Stickle here today I'm going to tell you eight things that you need to know before you leave FindLaw before you're firing fine law as your internet marketing company if you have unfortunately made the mistake of hiring fine law to handle your law firms internet marketing there's a very good chance that at some point you will be firing that company and going with the new new internet marketing company and here are eight things that you need to know to make sure that this is a smooth transition for you so number one is you need to make sure that you give 90 days notice it doesn't matter in most cases with the fine law contract you have to give 90 days notice regardless of when your contract is up so if your contract ends tomorrow payments don't stop tomorrow payments and 90 days from the time you give the the notice so make sure that you give plenty of notice because you don't want to end up getting stuck you know several months after your contract is up expecting that you're you're finished and lo and behold you actually still have a commitment for three more months the second thing you need to do is you need to hire a website coder because when they when they give you your website especially if you have one of those firm sites that they that they like to sell everybody I know they're starting to move to WordPress for a lot of things but a lot of lawyers have firm site websites which is a proprietary product that fine law uses so when you leave they tell you yeah you can take your website with you but the problem is is that all they do is they give you the files for the website they give you the files the content of the pictures and you have to actually hire somebody to put it together and make it a website it's not like you can just transfer the website and and just have a website that's up and running tomorrow it's not that easy so you're going to have to hire a website coder or somebody to rebuild your website for you so you want to make sure that you have that well in advance before you actually leave fine law so that you have that plan so that your website is down for the minimum amount of time number three get a reconciliation report of all invoices and billing and this can actually help you with this 90 days notice because a lot of times sales reps from fine law will sell products and services that will make it actually seem like you're locked into a contract much longer than you actually are and if you take a look at all the services and products that that they sold them that you're paying for and if you're not actually receiving those services or they're not actually performing then I have heard instances of lawyers that are able to break this 90-day clause and get you know sometimes I actually know an attorney that gotten money back from fine law so make sure that you get a reconciliation report of all invoices and all billing number for make sure to get admin access to your website before giving cancellation before giving your notice of cancellation otherwise they're gonna make you contact a third party once the transfer process begins to get your admin access and it's going to be extremely difficult so make sure before you actually give cancellation you want to make sure that you get admin access to your website because you own the website and you have a right to have admin access to it number five make sure that you check all website assets as they are transferred or after they are transferred you want to make sure that you have your website coder check this you want to make sure that all the content is there all the blogs are there you wanna make sure all the pictures are there all the CSS everything that's there because if this stuff is not there you can't rebuild the website they can't rebuild the website if all the pictures are missing so it's very very important that you guys verify as soon as possible that all the assets that are supposed to be there when they transfer the website and they give you that zip file or however they transfer it to you you want to make sure that all the assets are there and this is something that your website coder that we talked about in step number two or thing number two that's something that they should be able to help you with number six you want to get a detailed performance report of every aspect that they track this is your data you have a right to it you should be able to see Google Analytics your phone calls all that stuff because then you want to be able to track that after you leave fine loss so you can see how much things improve or you know what the difference is for your for your new your new website your new marketing this is something as an SEO company as an internet marketing company we always like to have past performance reports from our last clients because it allows us to see how we're doing it allows us to see that you know now they're getting a thousand hits per month and before they were only getting six hundred hits per month so we know what that benchmark is but you know if there's an instance where they're getting a thousand and before they were getting 1200 we need to know that well because it means that something in the transition process didn't work so make sure that you get a detailed performance report for every aspect of your website this is your data you own it you have a right to it number seven is to make sure that you request all logins for everything that fine law set up for you so this could be your Google my business profile this could be your Google Analytics this could be your Yelp account this could be any business profile that fine law has set up for you and again you want to make sure to get this at this access before they before you actually put your notice and because once you put your notice and it's gonna be very very difficult for you to get this information from them you're gonna have to stay on them and on them and on them if you're a paying client it's a lot easier for you to make some noise and make sure that they give you all this stuff so make sure that you request all of your logins because it is a nightmare if you have to try to get them later and the company won't cooperate so the eighth and final thing that you need to know before leaving fine law is that you need to start with your new internet marketing vendor before you actually leave fine log you don't want to be starting on the day that you leave fine law you don't wanna be starting with a new company because you can't just flip a switch that's not how it works with fine law you're gonna have to either rebuild your website or build a new website which is what we typically do for our clients and that process usually takes about six to eight weeks so we need to rewrite the content we need to design the website we need to code the website there's a lot of stuff that has to go into it and if you you know if you end with fine law today and just start that process tomorrow you're going to be without a website or you have to rebuild a website you're gonna have kind of a halfway presence for six to eight weeks so what you need to do is you need to make sure that two or three months out that you're already starting with a new internet marketing company I know it sucks to pay double for internet marketing companies but unfortunately that's just what has to happen because you don't want to go two or three months without having an internet marketing presence without having internet presence for your law firm because that is pretty devastating and that will probably cost you more money than it would cost that to work with - with to internet marketing companies and then in the future kind of use it as a lesson to just remind yourself never to hire fine law again now if you are leaving fine law even if you're with fine law and you can't get out of a contract there's some things that you can do on your own without hiring a marketing company at all that that that can actually increase your your rankings and improve the number of phone calls that you get so what I did is I created a free guide that teaches lawyers how to get their law firm in the Google Maps and it's completely free basically it's a twenty four part video series I ship it out to you on a USB Drive we ship it right to your door all asking that you help me cover a small shipping and handling fee but what it is what's on this USB Drive is a twenty four part video series that shows you the exact process step by step that we use for our clients to get them into the Google Maps and it's all in very simple terms there's no technobabble there's no special skills or anything that are needed it's just very simple common-sense straightforward advice and tutorials over my shoulder tutorials where I actually one on the computer screen and alright one on the computer and I recorded the screen I said click here click here answer here optimize this and I show you step by step what it actually takes to get into the Google Maps that way even if you're still with fine law and they're basically just ignoring you like they do for most clients you can still work on your Google my business profile and you can still build links and you can still do all this type of stuff that will give you a better chance of ranking and getting clients because just because you're with fine law doesn't mean that you don't need clients so you need to be proactive with some of the stuff so if you're leaving fine law remember these eight things whether you're with fine law or you're trying to do it or you're on your own or you want to hire an internet marketing company doesn't really matter you still need to grab this course go to hae lawyers.com it's completely free twenty four part video series gonna show you well we actually do for our clients it's not like we time it's not like I'm telling you to

Google Maps to help you get more clients help you get more phone calls and ultimately make more money so hopefully this video was helpful if you have any questions at all leave a comment below in the
