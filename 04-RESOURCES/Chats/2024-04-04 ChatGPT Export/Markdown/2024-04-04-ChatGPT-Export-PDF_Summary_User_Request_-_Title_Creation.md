The document, "Automating Zoning Data Collection," discusses a pilot effort to automate the process of collecting zoning data across the United States to create a national, accessible, and standardized zoning database. This initiative is motivated by the lack of transparent, updated, and standardized zoning law data, which hinders the evaluation of zoning policies' impacts on various societal outcomes. The report outlines the process of using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automate the gathering, processing, and analysis of zoning documents. It suggests a hybrid approach combining manual and automated methods for higher efficiency and accuracy. The exploration highlights the potential of text analysis and NLP to streamline zoning data collection, while also acknowledging the limitations of fully automating this task due to the complex and nuanced nature of zoning documents.
