Naming a software product that focuses on database metadata editing is a critical task that can shape its market reception and brand identity. Given your expertise in areas like database development, DevOps, and cloud computing, you'd likely appreciate a name that not only resonates with your target audience but also encapsulates the functionality and ingenuity of your product.

### Key Elements to Consider

Before diving into some name suggestions, here are a few elements to consider in the naming process:

1. **Relevance**: The name should reflect the core functionality of editing database metadata.
2. **Memorability**: The name should be easy to remember and spell.
3. **Uniqueness**: A unique name will help your product stand out, but ensure it's not so abstract that people can't relate it to its core function.
4. **Scalability**: If you plan to expand the product's capabilities, the name should be flexible enough to encompass those additional features.
5. **Legalities**: Always check for trademarks or other legal restrictions.

### Name Suggestions

1. **MetaMate**: A straightforward and friendly name that emphasizes the product's focus on metadata.

2. **DataScribe**: This name emphasizes the editing aspect while keeping data central to the identity.

3. **EditifyDB**: A blend of "Edit" and "DB," this name is direct in its messaging.

4. **MetaPulse**: This could evoke an image of a product that's always in sync with metadata changes.

5. **SchemaTune**: For more technical audiences, this name references database schemas, which are closely related to metadata.

6. **DataMetaCraft**: A name that implies craftsmanship and precision in metadata editing.

7. **EditMetaFlow**: Indicates a smooth workflow for metadata editing.

8. **DBMetaMorph**: A name that could signify the transformational changes you can make to database metadata.

9. **OrionDB**: If you're looking for something a bit more abstract, Orion is a prominent constellation, suggesting the product is a standout in its field.

10. **InferaMeta**: A blend of 'Infer' and 'Meta,' suggesting that the product not only allows editing but also provides insights into database metadata.

### Opinions

1. **MetaMate**: This is perhaps the most approachable name and would resonate well with a broad audience.
2. **SchemaTune**: This name would be more suited for a technically savvy audience who understand what a schema is and why it needs "tuning."
3. **OrionDB**: While abstract, this name has the benefit of scalability. It doesn't limit the product to metadata editing; you could expand the software's capabilities down the line without needing a name change.

I would recommend conducting a small survey or focus group testing to gauge how these names are received by your potential user base. Given your interest in best practices and design, the name should align well with the product's usability and overall user experience.
