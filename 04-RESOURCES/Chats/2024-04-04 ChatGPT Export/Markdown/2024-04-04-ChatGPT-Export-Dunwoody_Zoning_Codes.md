The Dunwoody, Georgia, zoning ordinance codes and land use cases, as available through the Municode Library, cover a broad range of topics essential for understanding the city's planning and zoning regulations. While I cannot provide verbatim content from the Municode Library, I can summarize some key aspects of Dunwoody's zoning and land use regulations based on the information found:

1. **Active Transportation**: Dunwoody's zoning code emphasizes the importance of pedestrian circulation within all new developments. The regulations detail the integration of new developments with existing networks and adjacent properties and include standards for lighting, safety measures (like bollards and raised crossings), and the layout of pedestrian pathways【7†source】.

2. **Solar Energy**: The city encourages the use of solar energy by allowing both accessory building- and ground-mounted solar energy systems by right, given they meet specific placement standards and comply with building and electrical codes. Additionally, there are limited exemptions for building-mounted solar energy systems concerning building height, setback, and screening requirements【7†source】.

3. **Urban Agriculture**: Dunwoody's zoning ordinances include provisions for urban agriculture, defining community gardens as an agricultural use. There are supplemental use regulations for community gardens, addressing the placement and size of structures and restricting on-site sales to appropriate districts【7†source】.

For detailed information, including the full text of these regulations and more comprehensive coverage of Dunwoody's zoning ordinance codes and land use cases, you can visit the Municode Library directly via this link: <https://library.municode.com/ga/dunwoody/codes/code_of_ordinances【6†source】>.
