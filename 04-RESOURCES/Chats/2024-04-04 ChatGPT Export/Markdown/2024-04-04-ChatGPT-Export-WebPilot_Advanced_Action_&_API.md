The WebPilot Action and WebPilot Commercial API both offer advanced capabilities designed to enhance the ChatGPT experience by enabling it to interact with web content and generate long-form content based on user inputs. Here’s a brief overview of both:

### WebPilot Action

- **How to add**: You can add WebPilot Action to your GPTs in about 30 seconds by modifying the GPT configuration, specifically by disabling "Web Browsing" and then adding the WebPilot Action using the provided OpenAPI schema URL.
- **Privacy Policy**: Ensures that user data is handled securely, with a clear policy available for review.

### WebPilot Commercial API

- **Advanced Features**: Offers more sophisticated and faster solutions like the Watt API for in-depth content search and analysis, and the Hugo API for generating extensive content, ranging from articles to reports.
- **Paid Offering**: These services are premium, paid offerings that provide enhanced capabilities compared to the free WebPilot Action.
- **Technical Expertise Required**: Utilizing these APIs may require some technical know-how or development resources to integrate with your applications.

**Watt API**: A powerful AI search API designed for precise content analysis and search capabilities, offering reliable and advanced solutions for digital discovery beyond what's available through the WebPilot Plugin.

**Hugo API**: A content generator API capable of crafting extensive pieces of content (up to or beyond 10,000 words) with precision and ease. It's versatile, supporting a wide array of content types from academic papers to creative stories.

**Other Information**:

- Users experiencing issues with text generation can report problems via email to the provided support address.
- The WebPilot browser extension, an open-source tool, enables users to perform a wide range of tasks on any webpage, further enhancing the ChatGPT experience with real-time web interaction capabilities.
