Git Flow is a branching model for Git, designed by Vincent Driessen. It's a structured way of managing branches in a repository to streamline the development process, feature integration, releases, and maintenance. The Git Flow model emphasizes the use of separate branches for different purposes, such as new features, releases, and hotfixes, ensuring a clean and organized project history. Below is an explanation of the primary branches and their roles in the Git Flow model, along with a conceptual diagram of how they interact.

### Primary Branches in Git Flow:

1. **`master`**: This branch stores the official release history. It should be stable and deployable at any time.

2. **`develop`**: Derived from the master, this branch serves as an integration branch for features. It's where daily development happens and where feature branches merge back into.

### Supporting Branches in Git Flow:

- **Feature branches**: Branch off from `develop` and merge back into `develop`. Each feature branch is dedicated to building a specific feature and is named accordingly (e.g., `feature/new-login-page`).

- **Release branches**: Branch off from `develop` and merge into both `develop` and `master`. These branches are used for preparing a new production release. They allow for minor bug fixes and preparing metadata for a release (version number, build dates, etc.). A release branch is named with the release version number (e.g., `release/1.2.0`).

- **Hotfix branches**: Branch off from `master` and merge back into both `develop` and `master`. These are used to quickly patch live production issues. Like release branches, they are named with the version number, but with a hotfix prefix (e.g., `hotfix/1.2.1`).

[ master ]------------------------------------------------------
               \                         /      \             /
                [ release/1.0 ]-----    [ hotfix/1.0.1 ]-----
               / \                     / \     /            /
[ develop ]------[---------------------   [-------------------
   |  \              |                     \             /
[ feature/alpha ] [ feature/beta ]          [ release/1.1 ]-----
   |                  |                                      \
[--------------------------------------------------------------...
```

- Development progresses in the `develop` branch, with new features developed in their respective `feature` branches.
- When a feature is complete, it's merged back into the `develop` branch.
- For a release, a `release` branch is created from `develop`. This branch is for final adjustments and prepares the project for a new public release. Once ready, it's merged into both `master` (tagging it with a version number) and back into `develop` to incorporate any last-minute changes made in the release branch.
- If a critical bug is found in production, a `hotfix` branch is created from `master`. Once the fix is completed, it's merged back into both `master` and `develop`, ensuring the bug is fixed in future releases as well.

This model supports a disciplined way of releasing software and managing fixes, making it easier to track and manage the development process's complexity.
