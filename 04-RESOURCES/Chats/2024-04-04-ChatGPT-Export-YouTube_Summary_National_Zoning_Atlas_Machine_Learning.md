Today's presentation focused on the National Zoning Atlas's research brief, where the team introduced their machine learning initiative aimed at digitizing zoning codes. This initiative seeks to complement existing efforts to digitize zoning codes, which are often lengthy, jargon-filled, and challenging to compare due to their decentralized creation at the municipal level. The team's goal is to make zoning codes more accessible and understandable through the application of machine learning techniques.

## Takeaways

üìä **Machine Learning in Zoning**: The integration of machine learning can significantly expedite the zoning code digitization process.

üîç **Complexity of Zoning Codes**: Zoning codes are characterized by their length, inconsistent terminology, and the use of jargon, making them difficult to process manually.

üåê **Decentralized Creation**: There are approximately 30,000 distinct zoning codes due to their creation at the local municipal level, showcasing the diversity and complexity of zoning regulations.

üìö **Educational Collaboration**: The project involves collaboration across multiple institutions, highlighting the educational community's role in addressing urban planning challenges.

üìâ **Data Collection Challenges**: The manual collection of zoning data is tedious and time-consuming, underscoring the need for innovative solutions like machine learning.

üîÑ **Hybrid Approach to Data Analysis**: A proposed hybrid model would combine human expertise with algorithmic analysis to improve efficiency in data collection and analysis.

üìù **Standardization of Zoning Documents**: The project also highlights the potential for creating more standardized zoning documents to aid in the automation process.

üîë **Large Language Models**: The use of advanced natural language processing, including large language models like GPT, offers new avenues for interpreting and structuring zoning code data.

üóÇ **Structured Data from Text**: The initiative aims to transform raw zoning code text into structured data that can be more easily analyzed and understood.

üåü **Community Involvement**: The project encourages community involvement and follows its developments through social media platforms.
