# Common Intermediate Language (CIL)

> [!SOURCE] Sources:
> - *[Common Intermediate Language - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language)*

> [!TIP] *Common Intermediate Language (CIL)* is also referred to as *Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL)* or *Intermediate Language (IL)*.

**Common Intermediate Language (CIL)**, formerly called **Microsoft Intermediate Language** (**MSIL**) or **Intermediate Language** (**IL**) is the *intermediate language binary instruction set defined within the [[Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)]] specification.*

CIL instructions are executed by a CIL-compatible runtime environment such as the [[Common Language Runtime]]. Languages which target the [[CLI]] compile to CIL. CIL is [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented), [stack-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine "Stack machine") [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode "Bytecode"). Runtimes typically [just-in-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation "Just-in-time compilation") compile CIL instructions into [native code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_code "Native code").
