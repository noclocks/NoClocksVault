## Definition

A **content management system** (**CMS**) is [computer software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software "Computer software") used to manage the creation and modification of digital content ([content management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management "Content management")).

A CMS is typically used for [[Enterprise Content Management (ECM)]] and [[Web Content Management (WCM)]].

[[Enterprise Content Management (ECM)|ECM]] typically supports multiple users in a collaborative environment by integrating **document management**, **[[Digital Asset Management]]**, and **Record Retention**.

Alternatively, [[Web Content Management (WCM)|WCM]] is the collaborative authoring for websites and may include **text** and **embed graphics**, **photos**, **video**, **audio**, **maps**, and **program code** that display content and interact with the user. [[Enterprise Content Management (ECM)|ECM]] typically includes a [[Web Content Management (WCM)|WCM]] function.

## Structure

A **CMS** typically has two major components:

1. **[[Content Management Application (CMA)]]**: [[Frontend]] [[User Interface]] that allows a user, even with limited expertise, to add, modify, or remove content from a website without intervention of a [[Web Master]]
2. **[[Content Delivery Application (CDA)]]**: [[Compilation|Compiles]] content and updates the website

Additionally, where the **CMS** is hosted is another form of segmentation:

1. On Premises
2. Cloud

> [!NOTE]
> [[Wordpress.org]], [[Drupal]], and other common **CMS** providers are *on-premises*.
> Some examples of cloud based **CMS** providers are [[SquareSpace]], [[Contentful]], [[Wordpress.com]], [[Webflow]], [[Ghost]], [[Wix]].
