## Overview

> [!DEFINITION]
> The [Business System](https://sourcemaking.com/uml/modeling-business-systems/business-processes-and-business-systems) Diagram identifies all of the business processes within a business system, captures the relationships between those processes, and identifies customers and suppliers of both business processes as well as the total business system. 

At No Clocks, we use a *twelve standard business system definition* for all organizations including *sales and Marketing, Customer Service, Operations, Procurement, Product Development, Finance, Human Resources, Information Technology, Facilities Management, Equipment Management, Enterprise Management and Improvement Management*. This basic organizing structure can apply to any industry type and any business size.

## What to Include?

Along with business processes, the Business System Diagram identifies several important additional elements for each process, such as process name, process owner, process purpose, the main process customers and suppliers, the main products and services of each process, the main inputs to the process and the primary measures. It provides a summary model for understanding the flow of work inside the larger business system. The BSD is not an IT architecture map. While information technology certainly has an impact, workflow is not just the IT component. IT encompasses all of the time, activity, and decision-making that contribute to executing the business system mission.
