## Overview

> [!NOTE] About
> Wikipedia: The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a browser-specific convention referring to all the objects exposed by the web browser. Unlike the [[Document Object Model (DOM)]], there is no standard for implementation and no strict definition, so browser vendors are free to implement the BOM in any way they wish.

Investigating the BOM:

```plaintext
window
|
+---document
|   |
|   +---anchors
|   | 
|   +---forms
|   | 
|   +---links
|   | 
|   +---images
|  
+---frames
|
+---history
|
+---location
|
+---navigator
|
+---screen
+
+---console
```

For the `document` element and its element beneath see the [Document Object Model](https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/about-Document-Object-Model).
