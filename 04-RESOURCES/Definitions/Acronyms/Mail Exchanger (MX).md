## Overview

> [!NOTE] About
> **MX** [[Domain Name Server or System (DNS)|DNS]] Records specify where incoming mail should be delivered on behalf of a domain. Every MX value has a unique priority (also known as preference) value. The lower the number, the higher the priority.

Email services will require you setup an **MX** record to establish a return-path for bounce/complaint reports from inbox providers.
