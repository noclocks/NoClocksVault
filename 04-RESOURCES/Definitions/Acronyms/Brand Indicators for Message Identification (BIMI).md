## Overview

> [!NOTE] About
> *Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI)* is an email authentication protocol that allows companies to display their brand logo in the email inbox of their recipients. BIMI is designed to increase brand recognition, email deliverability, and email security.

BIMI adds your brand logo to outgoing email messages.

It is configured via a `BIMI` `TXT` [[Domain Name Server or System (DNS)|DNS]] Record.

Some email providers support BIMI with a `TXT` record that refers to a [[Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)]] image file only. However, to display BIMI logos in [[Tool - Gmail|Gmail]], you must use a `TXT` record that refers to a [[Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)]] file. The [[PEM]] file includes your logo.

## Setup DNS Records

1. Create BIMI DNS TXT Record:
