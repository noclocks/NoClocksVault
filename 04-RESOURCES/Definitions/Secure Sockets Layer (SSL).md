## Overview

SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is an [encryption](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-encryption/)-based Internet security [protocol](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-protocol/). It was first developed by Netscape in 1995 for the purpose of ensuring privacy, authentication, and data integrity in Internet communications. SSL is the predecessor to the modern [TLS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/) encryption used today.

A website that implements SSL/TLS has "[HTTPS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-https/)" in its URL instead of "[HTTP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http/)."
