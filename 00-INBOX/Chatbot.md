# Chatbot

> [!SOURCE] Sources:

## Overview

A **Chatbot** is a computer program or an [[Artificial Intelligence (AI)]] application designed to simulate human conversation through text or voice interactions. It is a form of conversational AI that uses [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)]] techniques to understand and respond to user input in a human-like manner. 

Chatbots can be deployed in various platforms, such as websites, messaging apps, virtual assistants, or customer support systems.

## Key Characteristics

- **Natural Language Understanding:** Chatbots are equipped with [[NLP]] capabilities that allow them to comprehend and interpret user input, whether it's in the form of written text or spoken language.
- **Contextual Understanding:** Advanced chatbots can maintain context during conversations, remembering previous interactions and understanding references to past topics.
- **Response Generation:** Based on the input received, chatbots generate responses that aim to be relevant and coherent, providing helpful information or answering user queries.
- **Task Automation:** Chatbots can automate certain tasks or processes, such as answering frequently asked questions, providing customer support, scheduling appointments, or assisting with online transactions.
- **Integration with Backend Systems:** Depending on the use case, chatbots may integrate with backend systems or databases to fetch relevant information to provide accurate responses.

Personalization: Some chatbots are designed to remember user preferences and adapt their interactions to individual users' preferences and needs
