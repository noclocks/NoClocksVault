## Overview

- [[Certificate Authority (CA)]]

[[Web Browsers]] use [[Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)]] to encrypt traffic between client systems and server computers to protect confidential data such as social security information and credit card details. For an [[SSL Certificate]] to work properly, the entity that issued the certificate (also known as a [[Certificate Authority (CA)]]) must also be trusted by the web browser, which involves installing the issuer certificate so the browser knows that issuer is valid and reliable.

Commonly used certificate authorities, such as [[Verisign]], [[DigiCert]], and [[Entrust]], are automatically trusted by most browsers. However, if you use an untrusted internal certificate authority to generate [[SSL Certificates]] for internal resources, you will be nagged by your browser when you attempt to connect.

You can configure your system(s) to trust all certificates from a certificate authority by installing that systemâ€™s SSL certificate as a [[trusted root certificate authority]]. That way, the web browser will never prompt you again about accessing any site with a certificate from that CA.

> [!NOTE]
> This note focuses on [[Google Chrome]], [[Microsoft Edge]], and [[Mozilla FireFox]]. Steps listed here are accurate at the time of this writing, but future versions of these browsers may involve different menu options.

## Obtain the CA Certificate

First, you need to get a copy of the [[SSL Certificate]] from the [[Certificate Authority (CA)]] in `DER` format. 

## Manage Chrome Certificate Settings

1. Navigate to `chrome://settings/security` in the browser 
2. Select "Manage Certificates":
