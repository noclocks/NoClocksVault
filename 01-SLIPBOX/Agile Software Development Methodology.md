## Overview

Agile software development methodology is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that prioritizes flexibility, small frequent releases, and ongoing collaboration with customers. There are several different frameworks for Agile software development, including Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP), among others.

## Key Principles

- **Customer collaboration**: Agile values the active involvement of the customer throughout the development process. Customers are encouraged to provide feedback and be involved in the decision-making process.
    
- **Continuous delivery**: Agile prioritizes the continuous delivery of working software in small increments, rather than waiting until the end of the development cycle to deliver a complete product.
    
- **Flexibility**: Agile development embraces change and is designed to be flexible and adaptable to changes in customer needs or project requirements.
    
- **Incremental development**: Agile is characterized by rapid development of a small feature then a release, with the aim of rapidly validating customer feedback.
    
- **Cross-functional teams**: Agile teams are typically composed of individuals with different skill sets and expertise, who work together collaboratively to deliver the software.
    
- **Continuous improvement**: Agile teams focus on continuous improvement, constantly refining and improving their development processes to deliver better software more efficiently.
