## Overview

In [[Web Development]], [[Design Systems]] power the [[frontend]] teams of developers. This guide is meant for professional developers and will examine how the smartest teams engineer [[design systems]] at scale and why they use the tools they use. We'll walk through setting up core services, libraries, and workflows to develop a design system from scratch.

## Technical Aspects

1. *Common [[User Interface (UI)]] Shared Components*
2. *[[Design Tokens]]: Styling-specific variables such as [[Brand Colors]] and spacing.*
3. *[[Technical Documentation]]: Usage instructions, guidelines, do's and dont's, examples, etc.*

Other extra areas:

- **Testing**:
- **Deployment:**
- **Distribution**:

## Introduction to Design Systems

> [!TIP] A guide to the latest production-ready tools for design systems.

This guide is made for **professional developers** learning how to build design systems. Intermediate experience in JavaScript, Git, and continuous integration is recommended. You should also know Storybook basics, such as writing a story and editing config files ([Intro to Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook) teaches basics).

Design systems are exploding in popularity. From tech heavyweights like Airbnb to nimble startups, organizations of every shape are reusing UI patterns to save time and money. But there’s a chasm between the design systems created by BBC, Airbnb, IBM, or Microsoft and the design systems created by most developers.

Why do leading design systems teams use the tools and techniques they use? My co-author Tom and I researched the traits of successful design systems from the Storybook community to identify best practices.

This step-by-step guide reveals the automated tooling and careful workflows used in scaled production design systems. We’ll walk through assembling a design system from existing component libraries, then set up core services, libraries, and workflows.
