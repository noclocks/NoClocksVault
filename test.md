The Moon is estimated to be about 4.5 billion years old. This estimation is based on radiometric age dating of Moon rocks brought back to Earth by the Apollo missions, as well as meteorites that are believed to have originated from the Moon. These analyses suggest that the Moon formed not long after the Solar System itself came into existence.
