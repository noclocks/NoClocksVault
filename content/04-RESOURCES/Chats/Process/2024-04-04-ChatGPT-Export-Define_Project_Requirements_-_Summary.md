Based on the provided data, I've created a markdown table for the first five tasks and their associated subtasks:

| Title                              | Item Type | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1) Define Project Requirements** | Task      | Identify and outline the specific needs and expectations.    |
| a) Objective Identification        | Subtask   | Define clear, specific objectives or goals for the project.  |
| b) Needs Analysis                  | Subtask   | Assess the requirements necessary to achieve the objectives. |
| c) Stakeholder Identification      | Subtask   | Identify key stakeholders or target audience.                |
| d) Requirement Specification       | Subtask   | Develop a detailed document specifying project requirements. |

Would you like to proceed to the next table with additional tasks and subtasks?
