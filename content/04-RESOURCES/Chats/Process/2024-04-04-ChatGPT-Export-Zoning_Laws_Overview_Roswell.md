For an overview of zoning ordinances, land uses, and their descriptions for properties in Roswell, Georgia, you have a couple of primary resources to explore. The City of Roswell's official website provides information related to planning and zoning, aiming to balance the needs of residents and businesses while ensuring compliance with the Zoning Ordinance and the Comprehensive Plan【6†source】. This site might offer general insights into the city's zoning objectives and procedures.

For more detailed and specific information, Roswell's Unified Development Code (UDC) is a key document. Implemented on June 1, 2014, the UDC serves as a unified tool addressing contemporary development and zoning practices. It integrates zoning documents and maps in a format designed to be clear and accessible to administrators, developers, and the community at large【8†source】. The UDC likely includes the zoning codes, permitted land uses, and detailed descriptions you're seeking.

To access the legal text and specific details of the zoning codes and land uses, you can consult the Municode Library, where Roswell's Code of Ordinances and the Unified Development Code are published. These resources provide the most comprehensive and up-to-date legal framework governing land use and zoning within the city【7†source】【9†source】.

For detailed zoning maps, permitted uses, and specific ordinance language, you would need to delve into these resources directly. They are structured to provide a comprehensive guide to Roswell's zoning regulations, ensuring that development aligns with the city's planning goals and community standards.
