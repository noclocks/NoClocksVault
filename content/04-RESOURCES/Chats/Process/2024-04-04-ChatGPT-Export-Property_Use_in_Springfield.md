To provide you with specific zoning information for your property in Springfield, I'll need a bit more detail. Springfield is a common city name in the United States, with multiple states having a city by that name. Could you specify the state in which your Springfield is located? Additionally, if you have more precise details about your property, such as the address or the particular zoning district it falls within, that would greatly help in finding the most relevant information for you.
