reword this: We firmly believe the experience [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) provides will help you be a better developer. It provides live feedback as you write your code by defining expected data types, and either provides helpful autocomplete in your editor or yells at you with red squiggly lines if you're trying to access a property that doesn't exist or trying to pass a value of the wrong type, which you would otherwise have to debug further down the line. Whether youâ€™re new to web development or a seasoned pro, the "strictness" of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) will provide a less frustrating, more consistent experience than vanilla JS.

We are convinced that the experience offered by [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) will enhance your capabilities as a developer. Through its enforcement of explicit data types, TypeScript delivers immediate feedback as you code. This manifests either as useful autocomplete suggestions within your editor or as immediate error indications through red squiggly lines for attempts to utilize non-existent properties or incorrect data types. Such features preemptively address errors that might otherwise emerge in later stages of debugging. For both newcomers to web development and experienced professionals, the disciplined approach enforced by [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) promises a smoother and more predictable coding journey compared to using plain JavaScript.
