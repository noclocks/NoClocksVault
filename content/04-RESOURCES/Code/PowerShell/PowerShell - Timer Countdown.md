## Code Snippet

```powershell
function Start-FocusTime {
    param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true, HelpMessage = "Enter the amount of minutes you want to focus in")][string]$Minutes

    )

    #Get a list from your Task Manager for the correct names, look for them in the Details pane and add them without the extension
    #For example Outlook instead of Outlook.exe
    $ProgramsToKill = @(

        "Spotify",
        "Teams"

## Details

The [`Start-FocusTime`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22Untitled-2%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22Untitled-2%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22untitled%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%5D "Untitled-2") function in this PowerShell script is designed to help you focus on a task by closing certain programs for a specified amount of time, and then reopening them when the time is up.

The function takes one mandatory parameter, `$Minutes`, which specifies the amount of time you want to focus. This parameter is a string, and the function will prompt you to enter the number of minutes you want to focus if you don't provide it when calling the function.

The script defines a list of programs to close, stored in the [`$ProgramsToKill`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22Untitled-2%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22Untitled-2%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22untitled%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A8%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "Untitled-2") array. In this case, the programs are 'Outlook', 'Spotify', and 'Teams'. You can modify this list to include the programs you want to close during your focus time.

The function then informs you that it's starting the focus time and lists the programs it will close. It waits for you to press Enter before proceeding, giving you a chance to save any open documents in these programs.

Next, the function goes through each program in the [`$ProgramsToKill`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22Untitled-2%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22Untitled-2%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22untitled%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A8%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "Untitled-2") array and tries to close it. If it can't close a program for some reason, it will issue a warning and ask you to close it manually.

Once all the programs are closed, the function starts a countdown for the specified focus time. It displays a spinner and the remaining time in the console to give you a visual indication of the countdown. The countdown is based on a procedure from the `start-countdowntimer` package on the PowerShell Gallery.

When the countdown reaches zero, the function announces that the focus time is over and attempts to restart the programs it closed. If it can't start a program, it will issue a warning and ask you to start it manually.

This function is a useful tool for managing distractions and improving productivity. You can customize it to suit your needs by changing the list of programs to close or adjusting the countdown display.
