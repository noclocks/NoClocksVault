> This note is about ...

**Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language** (**TOML**) is a [file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format "File format") for [configuration files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_file "Configuration file").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML#cite_note-3) It is intended to be easy to read and write due to obvious semantics which aim to be "minimal", and it is designed to map unambiguously to a [dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_(data_structure) "Dictionary (data structure)"). Originally created by [Tom Preston-Werner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-Werner "Tom Preston-Werner"), its specification is [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source "Open source"). TOML is used in a number of software projects[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML#cite_note-6) and is implemented in many programming languages.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML#cite_note-auto-7)
