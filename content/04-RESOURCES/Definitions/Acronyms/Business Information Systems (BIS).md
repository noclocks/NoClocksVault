Business Information Systems (BIS) refer to the use of technology and information systems in the context of business operations, decision-making, and management.

**Key aspects:**

- **Information Management:** BIS involve the collection, storage, processing, and retrieval of business data and information. This includes databases, data warehouses, and information management systems. This also includes system quality attributes such as security, availability, privacy, and scalability.
    
- **Decision Support:** BIS decision support systems (DSS) and BIS business intelligence (BI) tools analyze data, generate reports, and provide insights to support strategic, tactical, and operational decision-making.
    
- **Business Processes:** BIS support and streamline business processes. Workflow management systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, and other process automation tools help organizations optimize their operations, improve efficiency, and achieve better coordination across departments.
    
- **Collaboration and Communication:** BIS facilitate communication and collaboration within organizations and with external stakeholders. Email systems, video conferencing tools, project management platforms, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and intranets/extranets enable effective communication, document sharing, and collaboration among employees, teams, and partners.
    
- **E-commerce and Online Presence:** BIS support online transactions, electronic commerce, and digital marketing. Websites, online stores, payment gateways, and social media platforms enable organizations to reach customers, sell products/services, and conduct business transactions online.
