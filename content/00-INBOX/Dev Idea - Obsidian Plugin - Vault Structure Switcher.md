# Dev Idea - Obsidian Plugin - Vault Structure Switcher 

Creating a Vault Structure Switcher plugin for Obsidian.md is a fantastic idea! This tool would cater to users with diverse organizational preferences, allowing them to adapt their workspace to their current needs or projects seamlessly. Here’s a step-by-step approach to flesh out your idea:

### Concept Development

#### 1. Define Structure Types
- **Flat Layout**: Minimal use of folders. Notes are primarily organized via tags, backlinks, and MOCs (Maps of Content).
- **PARA Method**: Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives. Plus an Inbox for unsorted notes.
- **Custom Structures**: Allow users to define and save their own structures, with presets for common workflows (e.g., Zettelkasten, GTD).

#### 2. User Interface and Interaction
- Easy-to-access switcher: A dropdown or a command palette option to switch between structures.
- Preview of structure changes: Before applying, show how the change will affect the current organization (number of notes moved, new folders created, etc.).

#### 3. Functionality
- **Dynamic Structure Switching**: Safely reorganize notes and folders without losing links or metadata.
- **Tagging and Metadata Update**: Adapt tags and metadata to fit the new structure.
- **Backlinks Update**: Ensure that backlinks remain valid and are updated to reflect structural changes.

### Technical Considerations

- **Data Integrity**: Ensure the switching process preserves all notes and links without data loss.
- **Undo Functionality**: Allow users to revert to the previous structure if the new one doesn’t meet their needs.
- **Performance**: Optimize for performance to handle large vaults efficiently.

### Advanced Features

- **Structure Templates**: Provide templates for popular organizational methods beyond PARA, like Zettelkasten or GTD.
- **Custom Rules**: Allow users to set custom rules for how notes are categorized or moved during the switch.
- **Integration with Other Plugins**: Ensure compatibility with popular plugins, enhancing the structural switch according to those plugins' features.

### Prototype Development

1. **Prototype the UI**: Start with mockups for the switcher interface and previews.
2. **Develop Basic Switching Logic**: Begin with the flat layout and PARA as they are distinct and cover a broad range of users' needs.
3. **User Testing**: Release an MVP to a small group of users for feedback on usability and functionality.

### Example Pseudocode

Here’s a simplified pseudocode example of switching to a flat layout:

```plaintext
function switchToFlatLayout(vault):
    folders = getFolders(vault)
    for folder in folders:
        if folder not in ["Templates", "Attachments"]:
            notes = getNotesInFolder(folder)
            for note in notes:
                moveNoteToRoot(note)
    updateLinksAndTags(vault)
    showMessage("Switched to Flat Layout")

function moveNoteToRoot(note):
    // Moves note to the root, updating paths and backlinks as necessary

function updateLinksAndTags(vault):
    // Updates all notes' links and tags based on the new structure
```

### Next Steps

- Start with designing the user interface and interactions.
- Develop a detailed plan for handling data safely during switches.
- Begin coding with a focus on the core functionality, starting with simpler structures.

This plugin would significantly enhance the flexibility and usability of Obsidian.md, catering to both users who thrive in a minimalist setup and those who prefer detailed organizational structures. How does this outline align with your vision?
