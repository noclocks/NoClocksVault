## Brand Kit Content

### Logos and Variations

> [!NOTE]
> First and foremost, your branding kit should include your logo, which serves as the face of your company. Your logo design should be adaptable to various formats, from business cards to billboards. The logo section in your brand kit should provide the main logo and its variations.

Logos should come in multiple forms:

-   the logo with the brand name,
-   a simplified or condensed version for smaller spaces
-   a favicon for web use.

Each variation should maintain the visual integrity of the main logo while being flexible enough for different applications. Providing options within the branding kit ensures that your team and any third-party collaborators have the right tools.

### Color Schemes

Your brand color scheme is the next critical component in your startup branding kit. This goes beyond simply choosing a favorite hue; it’s about selecting colors that resonate with your target audience and reflect your company’s values. Your brand colors should be consistent across all mediums and platforms.

Your branding kit should provide a brand’s color palette, specifying primary, secondary, and even tertiary colors, complete with hex codes for digital use and Pantone colors for print.

This ensures that whether it’s a website or a physical product, the colors are consistent and reflect your chosen brand aesthetic. Like your logos, these colors should also be versatile yet compatible, capable of maintaining brand integrity in different contexts.

### Typography

Fonts carry a lot more weight than most people realize when it comes to written content. Your branding kit should specify which fonts will be used in headers, body text, captions, etc. These brand fonts should be carefully selected to complement your logos and color scheme while providing excellent readability.

Sometimes, a unique font might be created to individualize a brand further. Whether you opt for something off-the-shelf or custom-made, the key is consistency. The typography section of your branding kit should guide users on when and how to use each font style, ensuring that your written content contributes to a unified [brand image](https://medium.com/theymakedesign/brand-image-a2e8fc77002d).

### Iconography

Besides logos and text, iconography is another crucial part of your brand’s visual language. Icons help in making your content more accessible and engaging, but they also need to fit within the general look and feel of your brand. This is where design elements come into play.

The iconography part of your branding kit should feature a series of icons that align with your brand imagery. These could be anything from social media icons to symbols used in your products or services. Like all other elements, these icons should be consistent with your brand colors, fonts, and overall aesthetic.

### Image Guidelines

The final but equally important component of your brand kit is a set of image guidelines. This section should outline the types of images that should and shouldn’t be used and in what context.

These brand guidelines are an extension of your brand’s visual identity, helping anyone who works on your brand — an employee or an external agency — select appropriate imagery.

A good brand style guide should go beyond listing what is acceptable; it should provide examples and best practices. It should clarify the mood or tone images convey, the acceptable range of compositions, and how to properly integrate text and other graphic elements into images.

This ensures your visual storytelling aligns with your [brand’s core message](https://medium.com/theymakedesign/brand-messaging-fb1c46fb9abc) and aesthetic values.

## Conclusion

Putting together a comprehensive branding kit for your startup may seem daunting, but the benefits outweigh the effort. By meticulously outlining how each of these elements should be used, you’re not only setting up your brand for consistency but also for success.

Your branding kit becomes the cornerstone of all your marketing activities, ensuring that everything you produce is aligned with who you are and what you stand for as a company.
