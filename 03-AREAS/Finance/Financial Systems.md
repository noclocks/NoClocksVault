# Financial Systems

> This document outlines the financial systems and processes that we use to manage our financial operations.

## Overview

As a Tech-based Startup, a primary goal for us is to be *lean and agile* with regard to our financial operations. We aim to keep our internal systems as robust, flexible, and scalable as possible.

This includes assessing and maintaining as little overhead as possible, while still providing the necessary financial
controls and reporting to manage our cash requirements, forecasting, and future investment in the company.
