# Tax Deductions

## Overview

Tax deductions are expenses that can be subtracted from your taxable income to reduce the amount of income that is subject to tax. The amount of tax you owe is calculated based on your taxable income, which is your total income minus deductions and exemptions.

## Types of Tax Deductions

There are two types of tax deductions: standard deductions and itemized deductions.

### Standard Deductions

The standard deduction is a fixed amount that is set by the IRS each year. It is available to all taxpayers and is based on your filing status. The standard deduction is designed to simplify the tax-filing process by allowing you to deduct a set amount from your taxable income without having to itemize your deductions.

### Itemized Deductions

Itemized deductions are expenses that you can deduct from your taxable income if you meet certain criteria. Itemized deductions can include things like medical expenses, mortgage interest, state and local taxes, and charitable contributions. To claim itemized deductions, you must file Form 1040 and itemize your deductions on Schedule A.

## Common Tax Deductions
