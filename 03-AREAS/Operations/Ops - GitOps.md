# GitOps

> [!SOURCES]
> - **

> [!NOTE]
> **GitOps** is a paradigm or a set of practices that emphasizes using [[Tool - Git|Git]] as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. In the GitOps model, [[Tool - Git|Git]] not only serves as the source control system but also as the central hub where all changes for infrastructure and applications are versioned and from which they are automatically applied and rolled out to the production environment.
