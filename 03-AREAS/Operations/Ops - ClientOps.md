# Client Operations (ClientOps)

At [No Clocks, LLC](https://github.com/noclocks), we use the term **ClientOps** (similar to [[DevOps]]) to represent **Client Operations**. See below for a full definition created by us at No Clocks (not an official definition):

> [!DEFINITION]
> **ClientOps** *(noun) `[klahy-uhnt-ops]`*:
> 1. A specialized division or methodology within a company dedicated to optimizing and enhancing all aspects of client interactions and service delivery.
> 2. The holistic approach to managing internal operations that directly affect client relationships, satisfaction, and retention, integrating principles from customer service, project management, and business analytics.
> 3. Aimed at improving client experience, streamlining communication, and ensuring effective service delivery through coordinated efforts across various departments such as sales, support, and management.
>
> **Example Usage:**
> *The ClientOps team implemented a new CRM system to enhance client engagement and streamline communication, resulting in a noticeable improvement in client satisfaction scores.*

This document will serve as comprehensive documentation, to be used internally at No Clocks, that outlines our **ClientOps** strategy and systems involved in detailing the objectives, methods, tools, and expected outcomes of our **ClientOps** initiatives.
