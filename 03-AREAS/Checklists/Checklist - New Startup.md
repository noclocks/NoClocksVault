### The Basics

- [ ] **[Incorporate](https://foreveryfounder.com/incorporation)**
	- [ ] [Choose a business structure](https://foreveryfounder.com/incorporation#block-ce91b565dae748f5ad1f4aabcba4aa3b) - Recommended Delaware C-Corp if you are going to raise funding
	- [ ] [Choose a jurisdiction](https://foreveryfounder.com/incorporation#block-9d3ddbdb41b34c159a109e8cedca1ff1)
	- [ ] [Incorporate online](https://foreveryfounder.com/incorporation#block-86e8b620b3e14d80b41ff1a716a1b418) - Choose your name, registered, agent, get an EIN
	- [ ] [Create a virtual business phone number and mailbox](https://foreveryfounder.com/incorporation#block-6effaddcff7848198d8bbe99ad1ef68c)
- [ ] **[Open a Dedicated Business Bank Account and Credit Card](https://foreveryfounder.com/money-management)**
	- You should have a dedicated business bank account and credit card, to separate personal from business expenses. If you do not you will run the risk of overpaying taxes, adding thousands of dollars of additional bookkeeping expenses, and waste your valuable time as a founder.
- [ ] Register with Secretary of State
	- [ ] Acquire a *Registered Agent* Lawyer to represent your company with the state
	- [ ] Submit your Articles of Organization
	- [ ] Submit your Operating Agreement
	- [ ] Receive Certificate of Existence
- [ ] Setup [[Accounting]], [[Taxes]], and [[03-AREAS/Finance/_README|Finance]] Software Tech Stack:
	- Every company in the US has to file taxes every year, regardless of whether or not they generated any revenue. The longer you wait, the most time consuming and expensive it is to clean up later - every dollar movement, from day one.
