## Overview

> [!NOTE] About
> This note serves as an index for all notes related to the topic: **Artificial Intelligence**.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI involves the development of algorithms and computer programs that can learn and make decisions based on data. It aims to create intelligent agents, which are systems that can perceive their environment, reason about it, and take actions to achieve specific goals.

AI has many subfields, including machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, computer vision, and expert systems. Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time. Natural language processing involves teaching computers to understand and interpret human language. Robotics focuses on the development of intelligent machines that can perform physical tasks. Computer vision involves teaching computers to interpret and analyze images and videos, while expert systems involve creating systems that can make decisions based on expert knowledge in a specific domain.

AI has many real-world applications, including speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, and predictive analytics. AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and manufacturing. However, AI also raises many ethical and societal concerns, including job displacement, bias, privacy, and security. Therefore, it is important to ensure that AI is developed and used responsibly and ethically.

## AI Tools

AI tools refer to software applications, libraries, or frameworks that leverage artificial intelligence techniques to assist users in performing various tasks. These tools often use machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and other AI technologies to automate processes, make predictions, extract insights, and improve decision-making.

- **[[Chatbot|Chatbots]]:** These AI tools use natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user queries, providing automated customer support or information retrieval.
- **[[Large Language Models (LLMs)]]:**
