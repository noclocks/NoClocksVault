## Overview

> [!NOTE]
> *This checklist is a guide to help ensure that all the necessary information and resources are in place to start a new project. It is a good idea to go through this checklist with your team and stakeholders to ensure that everyone is on the same page.*

How a development project starts sets the tone for the entire effort. Getting the logistical, communication, and project management structures in place can really help kick off a project the right way and spur immediate productivity.
 
This guidebook is a checklist of items that we find extremely helpful, and sometimes essential, during the beginning of a project.

These are things we always do or at least understand why we aren't.
