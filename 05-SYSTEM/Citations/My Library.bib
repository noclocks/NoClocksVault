Developing the capacity and skills of students and actuarial analysts is essential for actuarial practices. In this study, the use of R is proposed as a decision support tool for in the field of actuarial teaching and practice, as a complement to the existing excel and other existing platform. Count data was fitted using six regression models, out of which zero-inflated Poisson model is considered to be most suitable model for the count data based on model selection criteria; also procedure for reserving is demonstrated. It is expected that this would promote the use of R among academia and practitioners.},

The model proposes a combination of the between- and within-subportfolios (run-off triangles) estimating functions for regression parameter estimation, which take into account the correlation and variation of the run-off triangles. The proposed method is robust to the error correlation structure, improves the efficiency of parameter estimators, and is useful for the estimation of the reserve risk margin and value at risk (VaR) in actuarial and finance applications.},

Tail factors are used by actuaries to estimate the additional development that will occur after the eldest maturity in a given loss development triangle, or after the eldest credible link ratio. Over the years, many valuable contributions have been made to the CAS literature that describes various methods for calculating tail factors. The CAS Tail Factor Working Party prepared this paper on the methods currently used by actuaries to estimate loss development `tail' or `completion' factors. Standard terminology for discussing aspects of link ratios and tail development is communicated within the paper. Descriptions of the advantages and disadvantages of each method are included as well general indications of what types of entities (companies, rating bureaus, or consulting firms) typically use each method.},

To this end, we propose an infrastructure that can be deployed on top of the legacy databases of insurance companies.

The overall solution must achieve a variety of goals: Minimizing processing time requires efficient code; ensuring accuracy with routines to detect data anomalies throughout the process; maximizing the solution's analytical value, which requires close consultation with the users and an understanding of their business issues. We can enable business users to manage changes in certain business rules without re-programming by using tools familiar to users (e.g., Microsoft Excel) and the SAS{\textregistered} macro language to automatically generate new code during each periodic production run.},

This monograph begins by first testing the performance of the Mack model on incurred data, and the Bootstrap Overdispersed Poisson model on paid data. It then will identify features of some Bayesian MCMC models that improve the performance over the above models. The features examined include 1) recognizing correlation between accident years; (2) introducing a skewed distribution defined over the entire real line to deal with negative incremental paid data; (3) allowing for a payment year trend on paid data; and (4) allowing for a change in the claim settlement rate. While the specific conclusions of this monograph pertain only to the data in the CAS Loss Reserve Database, the breadth of this study suggests that the currently popular models might similarly understate the range of outcomes for other loss triangles. This monograph then suggests features of models that actuaries might consider implementing in their stochastic loss reserve models to improve their estimates of the expected range of outcomes"--Front cover verso},

This paper presents u mathematical framework IO answer those questionsfor the class of linear link ratio estimators used in practice. A more accurate method of calculating link ratios is derived based on classical regression theory. The circumstances under which the traditional methods could be considered optimal are discussed. It is shown that two traditional estimators may in fact be least squares estimators depending on the set of assumptions one believes governs the process of loss development. Form\&s for variances ox and confidence intervals around, point estimates of ultimate loss and loss reserves are derived. A triangle of incurred loss dollars is analyzed to demonstrate the concepts and techniques. A summary of a simulation study is presented and suggests that the performance of the incurred loss development technique based on the more general least squares estimator may approach that of the Bomhuetter-Ferguson and Stanard-Buhlmann techniques in some situations. The requisite mathematics is within the reach of the actuarial student equipped with the first three exams.},

  abstract = {This paper evaluates the foundation of loss reserving methods currently used by actuaries in property casualty insurance. The chain-ladder method, also known as the weighted loss development method in North America, is the most commonly used actuarial technique for loss reserving and setting liabilities for property/casualty insurers. Many actuaries believe that the basic assumption underlying this model is the future development of losses is dependent on losses to date for each accident year. We shall see that this is not the case and the method may be rooted in the complete independence of future loss development. The alternative assumptions are, in this author's opinion, a more natural way of analyzing the loss triangle. We shall also show that most of the methods used by actuaries are based on one common basic model, and the differences lie in how and which of the parameters are being estimated. The exposition provides some new insight to reserving methods. While it enriches our understanding of the loss reserving process and defines the common thread among various methods, it challenges some commonly held views in the actuarial profession. The exposition here points out a flaw in the Bornhuetter-Ferguson methodology as well as questions the basic framework of the loss development methodology. We shall show that we can obtain the same results as the loss development method under the assumption that the future losses are independent of what we know currently.},

In many cases, the build process for the container's image is created from instructions provided in a Dockerfile format. In support of this approach, we present a set of rules to help researchers write understandable Dockerfiles for typical data science workflows. By following the rules in this article, researchers can create containers suitable for sharing with fellow scientists, for including in scholarly communication such as education or scientific papers, and for effective and sustainable personal workflows.},

One of the conclusions of this numerical illustration is that zero-modified regression models are necessary to capture the impact of risk factors.},

It combines the benefits of various open-source software tools including R Markdown, Git, Make, and Docker, whose interplay ensures seamless integration of version management, dynamic report generation conforming to various journal styles and full cross-platform and long-term computational reproducibility. The workflow ensures meeting the primary goals that 1) the reporting of statistical results is consistent with the actual statistical results (dynamic report generation), 2) the analysis exactly reproduces at a later time even if the computing platform or software is changed (computational reproducibility), and 3) changes at any time (during development and post-publication) are tracked, tagged, and documented while earlier versions of both data and code remain accessible. While the research community increasingly recognizes dynamic document generation and version management as tools to ensure reproducibility, we demonstrate with practical examples that these alone are not sufficient to ensure long-term computational reproducibility. Leveraging containerization, dependence management, version management, and literate programming, the workflow increases scientific productivity by facilitating later reproducibility and reuse of code and data.},

Various methods have been widely dealt with in the actuarial literature. Exploration of the inaccuracies involved is traditionally based on a post-facto comparison of the estimates against the actual outcomes of the settled claims. However, until recent years it has not been usual to consider the inaccuracies inherent in claims reserving in the context of more comprehensive (risk theoretical) models, the purpose of which is to analyse the insurer as a whole. Important parts of the technique which will be outlined in this paper can be incorporated into over-all risk theory models to introduce the uncertainty involved with technical reserves as one of the components in solvency and other analyses (PENTIKAINENet al.

While R is not 100\% compatible with Splus (it is often described as a language ``which bears a passing resemblance to S''), many Splus programs will run under R with no alterations. Accordingly, much of the existing documentation for Splus can still be useful under R, and many authors of code for either language are careful to make sure that their code will be suitable for both languages},

When the number of observed zeros exceeds the number of expected zeros under the Poisson distribution, extra dispersion appears. This paper summarizes several dispersed and zero-inflated count data models, which are used to handle dispersion and excess zeros. We model the insurance claim count data with excess zeros with these models. We use chi-square goodness-of-fit, to test the validity of the assumption of the count data distribution and fit count data regression model with predictors. We compare the fits through AIC and BIC. The generalized Poisson model and Negative binomial model provide a good fit to the data.},

  journal = {CAS E},
  abstract = {Method Publicly available data as well as general insurance resources are used to investigate how to identify social inflation in the data and create a model to incorporate its effects into trend factors for pricing purposes. Results Significant research has identified a stair step pattern for severity that correlates with the crisis periods in the U.S. MedMal insurance market. Using this stair step pattern, a Level Shift model is created that can be used to analyze past cyclical trends as well as provide predictions for the next round of social inflation. Conclusions Medical Malpractice insurance follows a stair-step pattern of severity trend when analyzed on a Calendar Year paid basis rather than the standard Report Year or Accident Year incurred bases. This pattern can be used to incorporate past and future expected social inflation into the pricing and reserving processes. In addition, this method can be used to incorporate the effects of other ``Key Events'' such as changes in Tort Law into the actuarial projections.},
