A business technology audit, also known as a digital technology audit, is a comprehensive examination of an organization's online presence, assets, and activities across various digital channels. The aim is to assess the performance, effectiveness, and alignment of digital strategies with business goals [[00-INBOX/Business Technology Audit]]. 

The audit typically covers areas such as the organization's website, social media, content, SEO, online advertising, email marketing, and analytics. It involves evaluating the functionality, user experience, design, content, and SEO of the website; analyzing the presence, engagement, content quality, and effectiveness of social media profiles and activities; reviewing the quality, relevance, consistency, and performance of digital content; assessing the organization's visibility and ranking on search engines; examining the effectiveness and ROI of digital advertising campaigns; reviewing the performance, engagement metrics, deliverability, and relevance of email marketing campaigns, and using data from various sources to measure key performance indicators (KPIs) and derive actionable insights [[00-INBOX/Business Technology Audit]]. 

In addition, a website audit checklist can be used to perform a comprehensive analysis of a website's overall performance and effectiveness, including technical aspects, user experience, content, and search engine optimization [[Checklist - Website Audit]]. 

Lastly, "The Startup CTOs Handbook" provides insights into tracking, managing, or paying down tech debt, hiring, attracting, cultivating, and retaining top talent, creating an objective, fair, and transparent performance review system, building, managing, and sustaining a healthy and generative company culture, and enduring slow decision-making or endless circular arguments among technical staff about how to architect and build your system [[04-RESOURCES/Books/The Startup CTOs Handbook]].
