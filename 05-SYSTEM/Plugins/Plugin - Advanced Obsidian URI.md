## Overview

> [!SOURCE] Sources:
> - GitHub Repo: *[Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri)*
> - Documentation: *[Advanced URI Documentation - Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md/advanced-uri-doc/Home)*

Allows you to control many different features in [[03-AREAS/Obsidian/_README|Obsidian]] just by opening some [[Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)|URIs]]; Because they are just text and don’t require any mouse clicks or keyboard inputs, they are perfect to automate your [[03-AREAS/Obsidian/_README|Obsidian]] workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> [[03-AREAS/Obsidian/_README|Obsidian]] has the [[Obsidian - Core Plugins|core plugin]] [[Obsidian URI]], however, it has one (very minor) nuisance: When you open a [[Uniform Resource Loader (URL)|URL]] from this plugin, you have your note title highlighted and you have to manually move to the note body. With [Advanced Obsidian URI](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri) , when you open its [[Uniform Resource Loader (URL)|URL]]s, it goes straight to the note body, which is essential for quick note creation.
