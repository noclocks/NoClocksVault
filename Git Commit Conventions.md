## Overview

## Structure

1.	First line is a subject line. It should have size about 50 characters, maximum limit is 80. Subject line is capitalized and hasn't period at the end;
2.	A blank line separates subject from body;
3.	Detailed description of the change in the body, breaking paragraphs where needed. The body should explain what  you did and why vs. how. The body also starts with a capitalized letter. Bullet points are made with an asterisk (*);
4.	In case if a bug tracking system is used, bug Id's line is placed at the very end after a blank line.
